# Project Overview
	A simulation of the Predictive Maintenance & Production Scheduler Agent workflow has been built on n8n. This simulation demonstrates how an alert from a machine sensor can trigger an automated workflow that creates a maintenance ticket, notifies the team, and updates the production schedule via slack.
